## Requirements
In kubernetes 1.30 `TranslateStreamCloseWebsocketRequests` featuregate is true by the default making protocol between kubectl and kube-apiserver is websocket while prior is SPDY, this solution handles only websockets so the k8s cluster either has to be 1.30 or 1.29 with `TranslateStreamCloseWebsocketRequests=true` feature flag. Version below 1.29 are not supported.
